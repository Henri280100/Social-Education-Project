                                                ......  SOCIAL EDUCATION PROJECT ......

INTRO:

- Three college students talked to each other and they thought they should do their project to improve their skills. But, they still have no idea what this project is?Suddenly a boy stood up and said "Wut about Social Networking with Education" and from there, they came up with the idea for this project.

- That's the story of the project 😆 and the purpose of this project is about social networking combined with education. It not only serves the purpose of entertainment, but users can also create meeting rooms, create study groups and many more.
